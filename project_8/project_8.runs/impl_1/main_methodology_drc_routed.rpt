LUT cell d0/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_rom.rom_inst/g0_b0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) CLK1M_reg/CLR, CLK_reg/CLR, CNT8_reg[0]/CLR, CNT8_reg[1]/CLR, CNT8_reg[2]/CLR, CNT8_reg[3]/CLR, CNT8_reg[4]/CLR, CNT8_reg[5]/CLR, CNT8_reg[6]/CLR, CNT8_reg[7]/CLR, Q1_reg[0]/CLR, Q1_reg[10]/CLR, Q1_reg[11]/CLR, Q1_reg[12]/CLR, Q1_reg[13]/CLR (the first 15 of 71 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
